🌱 AI-Integrated IoT System for Precision Seedling Monitoring and Smart Farming Automation

📖 Project Description

This project focuses on the development of an AI-integrated IoT system for precision seedling monitoring and smart farming automation. The system is designed to continuously monitor environmental parameters that influence seedling growth and to automate farming operations using intelligent decision-making.

An ESP32-S3 microcontroller is used as the main control unit, connected to multiple sensors such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity. The collected data is transmitted wirelessly and displayed through mobile and cloud-based platforms for real-time monitoring and analysis. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are applied to analyze sensor data, predict seedling conditions, and support optimized farming decisions.

The system also integrates automated irrigation using a water pump controlled based on sensor readings and AI evaluation. A solar-powered energy supply is implemented to enhance sustainability and reduce dependency on conventional power sources. This project aims to improve efficiency, reduce manual labor, optimize resource usage, and support sustainable smart farming practices.
